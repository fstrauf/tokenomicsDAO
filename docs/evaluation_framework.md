# Evaluating Tokenomics

## Tokenomics Evaluation Framework
_High level framework / key questions for evaluating tokenomics_

**Supply**

Key Question(s): Based on supply alone, will this token hold or increase it's value? Or will that be inflated away?

**Total Supply**
- How many tokens exist today?
- How many will ever exist? (e.g. is there a supply cap in place?)

**Issuance Rate**
- Is the issuance rate fixed or variable?
- If variable, what are the factors that determine (and can influence) issuance rates?

**Allocation/Vesting**
- How was the supply initially allocated among investors, community, core team, etc?
- Are there any holder(s) with a significant stake that could drive material selling pressure upon vesting?
- What is the vesting schedule for the largest holders?

**Demand**

Key Question: Why would someone hold this token?

**ROI**
- Excluding any price appreciation, what return is generated by simply holding the token?
- Is there an opportunity to earn an additional return by yield farming?
- Are earnings/fees generated from the protocol distributed back to token holders?
- Does any "rebasing" take place as the protocol inflates?
  _Rebasing works stimilar to a stock split, whereby holding and staking the token enables the holder to receive more, thereby offsetting any impact of inflation and holding % ownership constant_

**Community**
- How active is the Discord/Twitter?
- Have any grants, hackathons or ecosystem funds been announced?
- How is the protocol actively working to drive additional community engagement?
- Do one-time + ongoing initiatves drive additional token demand?

**Lockups**
- Is there a lockup program in place?
- If there is a lockup program in place, what is the incremental value of rewards and what are the requirements to earn those rewards?
- What % of total tokens outstanding are locked up?
- How much selling pressure is generated upon lockup expiration (and at what dates)?
- Are there other non-monetary benefits to staking + locking up tokens? For example, does staking result in increased voting power?
