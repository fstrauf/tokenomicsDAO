# Evaluating Tokenomics

## Tokenomics Evaluation Framework
_High level framework / key questions for evaluating tokenomics_

**Supply**

Key Question(s): Based on supply alone, will this token hold or increase it's value? Or will that be inflated away?

**Total Supply**
- How many tokens exist today?
- How many will ever exist? (e.g. is there a supply cap in place?)

**Issuance Rate**
- Is the issuance rate fixed or variable?
- If variable, what are the factors that determine (and can influence) issuance rates?

**Allocation/Vesting**
- How was the supply initially allocated among investors, community, core team, etc?
- Are there any holder(s) with a significant stake that could drive material selling pressure upon vesting?
- What is the vesting schedule for the largest holders?

***Types of allocations***
- ecosystem incentives: to my understanding this means everything that encourages people to engage with the ecosystem. so this can be staking/LP rewards, bounties, in-game rewards, rewards for participation in DAOs etc
- foundation: i think this might be things like grants offered to developers to build on a protocol, or designers to build stuff in a game etc
- treasury: treasury of the DAO so that token holders eligible in governance decisions can decide what the treasury is used for. The projects (DeFi, P2E, etc.) will drive a lot of how a treasury is used. A media DAO like Bankless might use it to pay contributors, projects might use it to fund new developments and others will likely use it to provide liquidity or even collect their own liquidity via Olympus pro.

**Demand**

Key Question: Why would someone hold this token?

**ROI**
- Excluding any price appreciation, what return is generated by simply holding the token?
- Is there an opportunity to earn an additional return by yield farming?
- Are earnings/fees generated from the protocol distributed back to token holders?
- Does any "rebasing" take place as the protocol inflates?
  _Rebasing works stimilar to a stock split, whereby holding and staking the token enables the holder to receive more, thereby offsetting any impact of inflation and holding % ownership constant_

**Community**
- How active is the Discord/Twitter?
- Have any grants, hackathons or ecosystem funds been announced?
- How is the protocol actively working to drive additional community engagement?
- Do one-time + ongoing initiatves drive additional token demand?

**Lockups**
- Is there a lockup program in place?
- If there is a lockup program in place, what is the incremental value of rewards and what are the requirements to earn those rewards?
- What % of total tokens outstanding are locked up?
- How much selling pressure is generated upon lockup expiration (and at what dates)?
- Are there other non-monetary benefits to staking + locking up tokens? For example, does staking result in increased voting power?
